# Hubster

Hubster is an app that lets you search for users on GitHub. You can search for anyone's username and find information about them.

## How does Hubster work? ðŸ¤”

Hubster is a simple app built on top of the public GitHub API (which is really good!). Hubster does not require users to login and does not use its own API key behind the scenes. However, this was part of my intention with the project. I was curious how nice of a user experience I could make when running into walls such as rate-limiting.

## What does the tech look like? ðŸ’»

The stack I used consists of:

- Next.js
- React
- Chakra UI
- TypeScript
- react-query

## Outcomes

In the end, the product came out nicely and met my initial goal of making a basic GitHub user search and learning some new tech.

I really wanted to dig a bit deeper into react-query's pagination capabilities, understand how to better type custom Chakra UI components, and dive into GitHub's REST API.

All in all, I think the design looks nice, I learned a lot about react-query, and always have an enjoyable experience when working with Chakra UI.
